# Prerequisites

The following packages are required to use the caver-js library.

Node.js
npm
gcc-c++
Testing in caver-js is implemented using the mocha testing framework. If you want to run unit tests in caver-js, you need to install mocha first.

mocha
Note caver-js can run on Node.js versions 12 and 14, and the recommended versions are:

lts/erbium (12.21.0)
lts/fermium (14.16.0)
If you are already using a different version of the node(for example, node v15), use the Node Version Manager(NVM) to install and use the version supported by caver-js.
