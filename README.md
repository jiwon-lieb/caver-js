# Overview

Welcome to the caver SDK API reference documentation site (version v.1.5.0 and higher).

Caver SDK is an API library to interact with the Klaytn Blockchain using HTTP or WebSocket. It is your starting point for building decentralized applications on Klaytn.

Caver SDK is available in JavaScript (caver-js) and Java (caver-java).

Are you new?&#x20;

### **Important Note**&#x20;

If you are using Kaikas, use the older versions (-v.1.4.1). caver introduced the [_common architecture_](https://medium.com/klaytn/common-architecture-of-caver-a714224a0047) with v.1.5.0. The new features of the common architecture are not compatible with Kaikas. It works fine with the functions from the prior version. See [Trouble shooting and known issues](https://github.com/klaytn/caver-js#trouble-shooting-and-known-issues) for more details.
