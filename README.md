# Overview

You are in the caver SDK API reference documentation site.

Caver SDK is an API library to interact with the Klaytn Blockchain using HTTP or WebSocket. It is your starting point for building decentralized applications on Klaytn.

Caver SDK is available in JavaScript (caver-js) and Java (caver-java).

**Important Notes** If you are using Kaikas, use the older versions (-v.1.4.1). With version v.1.5.0, caver introduced the [_common architecture_](https://medium.com/klaytn/common-architecture-of-caver-a714224a0047). The new features from the common architecture are not compatible with Kaikas. It works fine with the functions from the prior version. See [Trouble shooting and known issues](https://github.com/klaytn/caver-js#trouble-shooting-and-known-issues) for more details.
